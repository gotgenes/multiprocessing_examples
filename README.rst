= Multiprocessing Examples =

This is meant to start a collection of simple examples of how to use Python's multiprocessing module. The exercises are trivial but illustrative for educational purposes.

**NOTE:** Currently, I (Chris Lasher) have no idea how to use multiprocessing effectively. The idea is to put this code up here, let it be forked, and merge back in contributed solutions.
